# NodeConf Barcelona 

NodeConf Barcelona is the Barcelona-edition of the longest running community-driven conference for the Node community. 

After last yearâ€™s very successful WeNode-conference, these lot are back as NodeConf Barcelona, with 12 great talks from speakers from around the world. 

Topics are more advanced this year with lots of debugging, DevOps, performance tuning and of course robotics apart from some interesting use cases.
The conference will take place on Saturday 21st November.

On the following day (Sunday 22nd November) Igor, Hassy and Me (:D) from YLD! will host a workshop on Node.js Performance.
